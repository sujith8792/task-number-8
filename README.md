# Task 8: K-Means Clustering

## Objective
The goal of this task is to perform unsupervised learning using K-Means clustering.

## Tools
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the K-Means algorithm.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

## Dataset
- **Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset**: This dataset is used for clustering tasks. You can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python).

## Code Overview
1. **Load the Dataset**: The Mall Customer Segmentation dataset is loaded using Pandas.
2. **Data Preparation**: The relevant features for clustering are selected.
3. **Feature Standardization**: The features are standardized to improve clustering performance.
4. **Model Training**: The K-Means model is fitted to the data.
5. **Elbow Method**: The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters (K).
6. **Visualization**: Clusters are visualized using a scatter plot.
7. **Clustering Evaluation**: The Silhouette Score is calculated to evaluate the quality of the clusters.

## Results
- The Elbow Method plot is provided to help determine the optimal number of clusters.
- A visualization of the clusters is included.
- The Silhouette Score is printed to assess clustering quality.
